        "Do you ever feel like you're just going through the motions in life? Like you're stuck in a rut and not sure how to break out of it? Do you find yourself looking at the world around you and feeling disappointed with the status quo?The future can seem uncertain, and it's easy to feel confused and overwhelmed.",
        "It feels like the world is spinning out of my control, but i don't know what should i do. People around me advised me to open up and forget about these unpleasant things, to do something relax.",
        "However as an ordinary person, you don't have the space and time to put yourself in a relaxed state, especially in China. Houses, children, and cars are like mountains pressing down on ordinary people, unable to lift their heads and dare not stop.",
        "As a programmer, in the eyes of outsiders, this is a decent job with a high salary, but it is not the case. Ordinary programmers do the most tiring work with a low salary. If you need more salary, you can only change jobs, the company's salary increase is pitiful.",
        "So, i'm so confused about my future! Some other people say i should study and improve my skills, that can change my life, at least can change my salary. It seems like a good idea, so i learn vue2, vue3, it looks not enough! So React, Angular, NodeJs are also included in my learning sequence. What, not enough. Frame A, looks great! Learn it. Frame B, wow, excellent,Impossible not to learn!",
        "I learn more and more I get more confused! I found that I don't understand anything! The only thing I know is that I know how many ways to write the word 'Hui' in fennel beans in Chinese.",
        "These are just small complaints, life must go on. Just lie down!"
